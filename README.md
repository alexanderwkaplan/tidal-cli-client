## Update 2.0.0 notes
The app is now completly rewritten. Most of the new features are:
* More abstraction with components and cleaner code.
* Better error handling.
* Caching every api request.
* Configurable shortcuts.
* Unit tests
* Playback queue control

## Installation
Installation sources:
* Arch Linux:

    * Install a package [tidal-cli-client-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tidal-cli-client-git/) from AUR.
    
* Other distros:

    * It is prefered to install `tidal-cli-client` package from npm using command `sudo npm -g i tidal-cli-client@latest`. After installation you can run app from anywhere using command `tidal-cli`.
    
    * If you don't want to use npm installation you can clone this repo. Then you install other dependencies with `npm install` and run with `npm run app`.
    
    You must have MPV and W3M installed. On some systems you'll also need to check, if you have got w3m-img, because it is not always installed directly with w3m.

## Usage instructions
When you open app for the first time you can see a form. Input username (first) and password (second) to the boxes and submit. Then it loads the main app.

To change focus from one item to another, press `tab`.

### Action bar
On the bottom of the app there is a green bar. When you press `:` it automatically focuses itself. Most of the navigation in the app is based on this text input. The list of commands is as follows:
